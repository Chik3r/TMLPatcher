Convenient tool for packing and unpacking XNB files for various games and managing `.tmod` file archives.

## Frontends

- fnb provides its own CLI frontend included in the distributed binary,
- fnb is integrated into [my fork of ILSpy](https://github.com/steviegt6/ILSpy), which allows once to drag-n-drop `.tmod` archives directly into ILSpy.
